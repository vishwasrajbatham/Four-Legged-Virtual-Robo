# Four-Legged-Virtual-Robo

Hey everyone. In this project we tried to create a virtual robot with four legged walking mechanism. The project was a part of "Open Source Projects @ IITI Summer, 2020". 
We modelled the same in CATIA and SolidWorks, analysed the walking mechanism in MATLAB, and controlled it with the code written in Arduino.
